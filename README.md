# E-commerce-Back-End

This week's project is to create a functional Express.js API that interacts with a MySQL database using Sequelize for an e-commerce site.

## Description

The objective of this project is to develop a functional Express.js API that connects with a MySQL database using Sequelize for an e-commerce website. This will be the backend for an e-commerce site, leveraging Express.js API and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. Sensitive data is stored securely using Dotenv npm. The API will perform RESTful CRUD operations on the database using Sequelize methods. Additionally, the API routes will be tested using Insomnia Core.

## Installation

To use this app, users or developers who have cloned the repository should follow the guidelines below:

1. Create a .env file.

2. Run 'npm i'.

3. Log in to the MySQL database in the terminal by typing "mysql -u root -p".

4. Type "source ./db/schema.sql" to create a database.

5. Type "exit" to log out of MySQL, then type "npm run seed" to seed the database.

6. Once the seeding process is complete, the app is ready to be used.

Check out the Insomnia by Kong walkthrough video that demonstrates and tests the API routes for categories, products, and tags.
